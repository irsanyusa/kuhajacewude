Authorities call it&nbsp;“The Road to&nbsp;Nowhere” because it&nbsp;leads to&nbsp;the mountain and then turns into a&nbsp;dead end. Not even a&nbsp;McDonald’s.</p><p>Plus, on&nbsp;both sides of&nbsp;the road, there are <a href=# title=deserts data-link=tag>deserts</a> stretching for miles. Sometimes solo drivers, sometimes families... They all disappear. Their cars vanish with them. Authorities mention a&nbsp;cafe by&nbsp;the road where tourists stop by&nbsp;to&nbsp;grab a&nbsp;bite.</p><p>One day, a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;4&nbsp;entered this cafe. The waiter overheard a&nbsp;conversation between the husband and wife. Millie Waldrout suggested exploring the area and the scenery. Tom Waldrout wanted to&nbsp;rest and drink his coffee. So, Millie took their son and daughter for a&nbsp;short ride. She said they’d be&nbsp;back in&nbsp;an&nbsp;hour. They never returned. Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;true? Decide for yourself...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ddf/e7e/30d1f8541d95dcc610639a7cf8.png><p>Interstate-80 in&nbsp;the United States is&nbsp;a&nbsp;place where scary things happen on&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular basis. This particular part of&nbsp;this highway is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the northern part of&nbsp;Nevada. This area is&nbsp;known to&nbsp;have some of&nbsp;the most unforgiving and lifeless areas in&nbsp;the entire country. Imagine traveling there&nbsp;— sometimes, there’s nothing around but a&nbsp;desert and tumbleweed. You could drive for hours and never see another vehicle or&nbsp;person. So&nbsp;this part of&nbsp;I-80 has a&nbsp;well-deserved nickname: “The Big Lonely.”</p><p>One of&nbsp;the people gone missing there is&nbsp;Patrick Carnes, an&nbsp;86-year-old veteran. Before his disappearance, a&nbsp;police officer stopped him on&nbsp;the highway. His <a href=# title=dog data-link=tag>dog</a> was with him in&nbsp;the car. Later&nbsp;on, his car was seen in&nbsp;working order on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;the road. Carnes and his dog were nowhere to&nbsp;be&nbsp;found. This incident happened in&nbsp;2011, not so&nbsp;long ago.</p><p>Another missing person was 73-year-old Nan Dixon. She was on&nbsp;her way to&nbsp;visit her brother&nbsp;— at&nbsp;that time, she didn’t know she would never arrive there. She went missing in&nbsp;1978. Her car was eventually found in&nbsp;1982. Authorities never solved the case.</p><p>There was also 62-year-old Judith Casida. She disappeared in&nbsp;the same area in&nbsp;2006. She was last seen in&nbsp;the Lovelock Nevada McDonald’s. Ms. Casida hasn’t been found either. Over the past 3&nbsp;decades, hundreds of&nbsp;mysterious disappearances and a&nbsp;string of&nbsp;unsolved incidents have been reported along I-80. Some evidence was found there, but it&nbsp;wasn’t enough to&nbsp;find out who it&nbsp;belonged&nbsp;to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/566/d9f/da439a56269175746f9a252928.png><p>Route 29&nbsp;in&nbsp;Virginia got its fair share of&nbsp;mysterious disappearances, too. Since 1996, there’s been an&nbsp;unusually high number of&nbsp;missing person cases involving young women. Alicia Showalter Reynolds disappeared in&nbsp;March 1996. It&nbsp;started as&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular day for her. She was going to&nbsp;meet with her mother and go&nbsp;shopping. Her car was found on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;Route&nbsp;29. She was never found alive. No&nbsp;one knows who did&nbsp;it.</p><p>In&nbsp;the following weeks, other women reported a&nbsp;strange man trying to&nbsp;convince them to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Route&nbsp;29. Police released a&nbsp;sketch and received more than 10,000&nbsp;tips. Yet they never found the suspect. The disappearances continued in&nbsp;the following years. For instance, 5&nbsp;young women disappeared in&nbsp;5&nbsp;years between 2009 and 2014. Investigators said they were looking into the connections between the cases.</p><p>The next one is&nbsp;“The Trail of&nbsp;Tears”&nbsp;— officially Highway 16&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Canada data-link=tag>Canada</a>. It&nbsp;all started with the disappearance of&nbsp;Gloria Moody in&nbsp;1969. She was last seen attending a&nbsp;party. After all these years, despite all efforts, people still regularly go&nbsp;missing there. It’s believed that the last case dates back to&nbsp;2011. Madison Scott was <a href=# title=camping data-link=tag>camping</a>. Her tent and car were found, but Madison has never been seen again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/494/827/c1b1455a41908b722d4a24c960.png><p>The next road is&nbsp;the Appalachian Trail in&nbsp;the United States. This trail is&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the beautiful Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Maybe because of&nbsp;its beauty, it’s one of&nbsp;the most visited parks in&nbsp;the country. Around&nbsp;10,000,000 people come there every year. But some of&nbsp;those who drive or&nbsp;hike along the Appalachian Trail never get the chance to&nbsp;leave the park.</p><p>Take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;this case: in&nbsp;1969, several families were camping in&nbsp;the park for Father’s Day. Unfortunately, one boy, Dennis Martin, disappeared without a&nbsp;trace during this outing. Over&nbsp;1,300 people searched the area, but it&nbsp;didn’t help. No&nbsp;one found any clues.</p><p>Seven years later, Trenny Lynn Gibson vanished in&nbsp;the area, too. She was with a&nbsp;large group of&nbsp;fellow students and teachers. They were all hiking together on&nbsp;the same trail. She was the only one to&nbsp;disappear. There were other people in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;and behind Trenny.</p><p>Strangely, no&nbsp;one saw her. Her disappearance remains unsolved. There’s another person who went missing on&nbsp;the trail, too. These 3&nbsp;people disappeared under totally different circumstances. So, the authorities think there’s no&nbsp;connection between these incidents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6e6/e26/8f2478511a822d374197f86172.png><p>The Flinders Highway in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a> happens to&nbsp;be&nbsp;another place where people mysteriously go&nbsp;missing. On&nbsp;this road, people who disappear often get found&nbsp;— but it’s usually too late for them. There have been several cases reported over the years. It&nbsp;started in&nbsp;1970, and the last case happened in&nbsp;2017. From hitchhikers to&nbsp;elementary students... The scope is&nbsp;wide.</p><p>The highway stretches 560&nbsp;miles. The size of&nbsp;the search area doesn’t help the authorities either. Only two people were charged for some of&nbsp;the incidents; neither made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the trials. But what if&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn’t them and there was someone else all along? Why did the crimes stop? Was the person responsible for it&nbsp;in&nbsp;jail? Did they go&nbsp;underground? Or&nbsp;are they still out there, waiting for something?</p><p>The next one isn’t a&nbsp;lonely, abandoned road in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;nowhere. It’s a&nbsp;beautiful national park in&nbsp;the U.S. Despite being a&nbsp;natural beauty, Yosemite National Park gained fame for being one of&nbsp;the most mysterious parks in&nbsp;the world. Here, too, people keep disappearing into thin air.</p><p>There are many theories explaining these cases. Some people even blame supernatural creatures, like spirits. But one thing is&nbsp;definite&nbsp;— something is&nbsp;off there. Too many people have gone missing in&nbsp;the park.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d01/1ba/eb0f35536a9db37a7f303c02d1.png><p>Speaking of&nbsp;supernatural phenomena, here is&nbsp;a&nbsp;“haunted road” from the U.S. and the chilling story behind&nbsp;it. I’m talking about Aroostook County Route&nbsp;— short for Route 2A&nbsp;— in&nbsp;Maine. Route 2A’s conditions are quite dangerous. The road has sharp turns and gets covered with ice and snow during the winter. On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, drivers have reported seeing the ghost of&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;the road.</p><p>Another version is&nbsp;that they see a&nbsp;woman begging drivers to&nbsp;help her husband. When a&nbsp;driver gets out of&nbsp;their car and tries to&nbsp;approach her&nbsp;— poof! —&nbsp;she disappears. Many truckers weren’t lucky enough to&nbsp;complete this route safely. And truckers weren’t the only ones. The spookiness of&nbsp;the road even inspired a&nbsp;song.</p><p>Number 9&nbsp;is Riverview Drive in&nbsp;New Jersey. The road is&nbsp;known as&nbsp;“Annie’s Road.” The name comes from the supposed ghost of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman named —you guessed it&nbsp;— Annie. Legend has it&nbsp;she was involved in&nbsp;a&nbsp;truck accident on&nbsp;her prom night in&nbsp;the 1960s. Some motorists reported having heard someone screaming there. Then a&nbsp;mysterious fog filled the air&nbsp;— it&nbsp;appeared out of&nbsp;nowhere. Plus, they claimed to&nbsp;have interference on&nbsp;their phones.</p><p>Another haunted place is&nbsp;Harewood Road in&nbsp;Chesterfield, UK. This 3-mile-long lane is&nbsp;known for phantom monks. Rumor has it&nbsp;that some monks were sent to&nbsp;Harewood Grange to&nbsp;work the land as&nbsp;a&nbsp;punishment for misbehaving. The area has other scary places, too. Abandoned Hunger Hill Pumping Station is&nbsp;also close to&nbsp;the haunted road, and the atmosphere at&nbsp;the station is&nbsp;very uncanny. Well, while traveling, maybe you shouldn’t choose the roads where people have vanished before. Unless you’re a&nbsp;thrill seeker.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xedGomJ2rXaWysLzLnmStmZuaeqK6w2alnq6Vp3qku8yeZJuZk6B6eX2TbmpwZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./batman-actors-gallery.html>&#171;&nbsp;Batman and Robin Actors: A History</a>

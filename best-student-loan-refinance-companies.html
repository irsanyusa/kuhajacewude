However, if you happen to call the Lone Star State home, the company could help you save money over time with fixed interest rates starting as low as 4.75%.</p><p>Another important caveat—Brazos requires a stricter minimum credit score than most, with either the primary borrower or their cosigner needing a score of at least 720 to qualify. (If you’re applying with a cosigner, your score will still need to be at or above 690.)</p><h3>Best for larger loan balances: Citizens Bank</h3><p><span class=best-for>Larger loan balances</span></p><p><span class=best-for>Larger loan balances</span></p><h3 class=product-title>Citizens Bank Student Loans Refinance</h3><p>Loan amounts</p><p>Minimum $10,000 to maximum $300,000 for bachelor’s degree, $500,000 for graduate degrees, and $750,000 for professional degrees</p><p>Loan terms</p><p>Five, seven,&nbsp; 10, 15, or 20 years</p><p>APR</p><p>6.99% to 10.99% fixed; 7.29% to 12.44% variable</p><p>Credit score</p><p>N/A</p><p>While many lenders cap their refinancing loan at $100,000 or $150,000, Citizens Bank allows borrowers to finance up to $300,000 for undergraduate debt alone, up to $500,000 for graduate-level debt, and up to $750,000 for those who’ve attained professional degrees. Terms are flexible: Choose from five, seven, 10, 15, or 20 year repayment periods, all at competitive interest rates either fixed or variable.</p><p>Do keep in mind, though, that there’s a corollary to these higher loan maximums, which is a higher loan minimum. Citizens Bank will only refinance student loan balances of at least $10,000, so if you carry relatively little debt, it may not be the right fit.</p><h3>Best for low credit score: College Ave</h3><p><span class=best-for>Low credit score</span></p><p><span class=best-for>Low credit score</span></p><h3 class=product-title>College Avenue Student Loan Refi</h3><p>Loan amounts</p><p>$5,000 to $150,000 ($300,000 for medical, dental, pharmacy, and veterinary doctorate degrees)</p><p>Loan terms</p><p>Flexible between five and 20 years</p><p>APR</p><p>4.43% to 17.99% fixed; 5.59% to 17.99% variable</p><p>Credit score</p><p>No set minimum</p><p>With no set minimum credit score and a qualification process that takes other financial factors into account, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>College Ave</a> could help borrowers with less-than-perfect credit refinance their student loans—and perhaps even improve their scores over time, depending on their repayment habits.

Interest rates start at just 5.99%, but climb as high as 11.24% for less qualified borrowers.</p><h3>Best for multiple loan types: LendKey</h3><p><span class=best-for>Multiple loan types</span></p><p><span class=best-for>Multiple loan types</span></p><h3 class=product-title>LendKey Student Loan Refi</h3><p>Loan amounts</p><p>Minimum $5,000 to maximum $125,000 for undergraduate debt; $250,000 for graduate school debt</p><p>Loan terms</p><p>Five, seven,&nbsp; 10, 15, or 20 years</p><p>APR</p><p>5.24% to 9.35% fixed; 5.55% to 8.73% variable</p><p>Credit score</p><p>N/A</p><p>For those looking for a one-stop shop, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>LendKey</a> offers more than student loan refinancing: You can also take out private student loans while you’re actively enrolled in study, as well as home improvement loans, through the site.</p><p>It’s important to understand, however, that <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>LendKey</a> is not actually a direct lender. Instead, it’s a service that connects borrowers to banks and credit unions that offer lower-cost loans. That means you may have more options to choose from if you apply, but also that your information will likely be shared with multiple companies.</p><h3>Best for parents and cosigners: PenFed</h3><p><span class=best-for>Parents and cosigners</span></p><p><span class=best-for>Parents and cosigners</span></p><h3 class=product-title>Penfed Student Loan Refi</h3><p>Loan amounts</p><p>N/A</p><p>Loan terms</p><p>N/A</p><p>APR</p><p>7.74% to 9.93% fixed</p><p>Credit score</p><p>N/A</p><p>Not every student loan refinancing company offers borrowers the opportunity to enlist the help of a cosigner—but <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>PenFed</a> does.

The firm’s maximum loan amount is not available to the public, however, and their interest rates range from 7.74% to 9.93%, which is not the lowest bracket on our list.</p><h3>Best for deferred repayment options: RISLA</h3><p><span class=best-for>Deferred refinancing while they’re still in school</span></p><p><span class=best-for>Deferred refinancing while they’re still in school</span></p><h3 class=product-title>RISLA Student Loan Refi</h3><p>Loan amounts</p><p>$7,500 per year to $250,000 maximum based on degree type</p><p>Loan terms</p><p>Five, 10, or 15 years (depending on loan type)</p><p>APR</p><p>6.34% to 8.54% fixed</p><p>Credit score</p><p>680, with a $40,000&nbsp; minimum income requirement</p><p>Refinancing loans often require repayment within a month or two of signing the loan, which, of course, is more difficult for those who are still in school. However, if you’re an actively enrolled college student looking to get ahead of not-so-excellent student loan terms you agreed to a few semesters ago, the <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Rhode Island Student Loan Authority (RISLA)</a> may be able to help.</p><p>Along with a more traditional, immediate refinancing option for those who’ve already graduated, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>RISLA</a> offers deferred refinancing for those who are still in school. Like many other types of student loans, including government loans, you won’t be required to begin repaying these loans until six months after you’re out of school. Keep in mind, however, that <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>RISLA</a> does have a $40,000 minimum income requirement along with its 680 minimum credit score, though a cosigner may help students meet these requirements even while enrolled full time.</p><h3>Best for smaller loan balances: SoFi</h3><p><span class=best-for>Smaller loan balances</span></p><p><span class=best-for>Smaller loan balances</span></p><h3 class=product-title>Sofi Student Loan Refi</h3><p>Loan amounts</p><p>$5,000 to $100,000</p><p>Loan terms</p><p>Five, seven,&nbsp; 10, 15, or 20 years</p><p>APR</p><p>5.24% to 9.99% fixed; 6.24% to 9.99% variable</p><p>Credit score</p><p>650</p><p>Since opening its doors in 2011, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>SoFi</a> has become a major name in the lending space, both inside and outside of student loan refinancing.

Here are some tips for comparing student loan refinance lenders, no matter your financial situation.</p><h3>Keep your specific needs in mind</h3><p>Not all student loan refinancing products are created equal, but this is OK, because not everyone has the same refinancing needs. For example, if you have a higher student debt balance, a company whose loans max out at $100,000 might not work, even if it has lower rates than a competitor.</p><h3>Look for the lowest rates—but not exclusively</h3><p>Saving money by scoring a lower interest rate is one of the biggest motivators for refinancing your student loans in the first place, but it’s not the only one. Refinancing can also help by extending your repayment period or lowering your monthly bill, which might mean you pay more interest in the long run but are able to make ends meet in the short term.</p><p>Furthermore, the company with the very lowest interest rates may not offer other benefits that are important to you, such as penalty-free early repayment or deferral and hardship options.</p><h3>If your credit isn’t great, consider a cosigner</h3><p>Waiting until your financial situation has improved can help you qualify for a lower interest rate and better overall refinancing loan terms. However, if you want to refinance sooner than later, even though your credit could still use some polishing, a <a rel=nofollow href=#>cosigner</a> may be able to help you qualify.</p><p>Keep in mind that your cosigner is as legally responsible for your debt as you are, so cosigning is a pretty big favor to ask. Furthermore, the bank may still have minimum creditworthiness requirements for cosigners, so having one isn’t a guarantee of approval.</p><h2 id=what-are-the-alternatives-to-student-loan-refinancing>What are the alternatives to student loan refinancing?</h2><p>If the timing’s just not right for student loan refinancing, you may still have options.</p><h3>Apply for an income-driven repayment plan</h3><p>If you have federal student loans, you may be eligible to enroll in an <a rel=nofollow href=#>income-driven repayment plan</a>, which will adjust your monthly payment based on how much money you earn and the size of your family. For some the income-driven repayment plan may even result in a monthly payment of $0.</p><h3>Look into student loan forgiveness</h3><p>Depending on your profession and the type of student loans you have, you may qualify for <a rel=nofollow href=#>student loan forgiveness</a> programs at the state and/or federal level. Teachers, government workers, nonprofit employees, medical professionals—and those who have become totally and permanently disabled—may all be eligible to have their federal student loans discharged.</p><p>There are also many state-based loan forgiveness and repayment programs to look into. For example, <a rel=nofollow href=#>California’s State Loan Repayment Program (SLRP)</a> offers grants of up to $50,000 per applicant for healthcare professionals who commit to work two or four years in certain California markets. Check with your own local government to learn about options that may pertain to you. (Note that these forgiveness programs are usually only accessible to those with federal student loans.)</p><h3>Ask for hardship assistance, deferral, or forbearance</h3><p>Unlike federal student loans, forbearance and hardship assistance programs vary among private lenders; if you have privately funded student loans, these options may or may not be available to you. If they are, though, they can be a way to temporarily quell the onslaught of student loan bills while you attend to other financial needs. Keep in mind that your loan may continue to accrue interest during the forbearance period. If you have student loans that have been in forbearance, a <a rel=alternate href=#>recent 2022 government program</a> may provide a pathway to having your loans forgiven.</p><h3>Try to improve your creditworthiness and cash flow</h3><p>Just because refinancing isn’t an option today doesn’t mean it won’t be tomorrow. By finding ways to earn more money and keeping positive credit habits, such as making payments in full and on time, you may be able to improve your financial profile and eventually qualify for a refinancing loan that could save you money over time.</p><h2 id=time-stamp-student-loan-refinancing-can-solve-a-number-of-problems>TIME Stamp: Student loan refinancing can solve a number of problems</h2><p>Student loan refinancing is one way borrowers can save money on interest, lower their monthly payments, extend their loan’s repayment period, or possibly even all three. Which lender is best suited for you will depend on your specific financial situation and needs, but many options are available on today’s market.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What are the repayment terms and options provided by the best student loan refinancing companies?</h3><p>Each student loan refinancing company offers its own range of repayment terms and options. In most cases borrowers will get to choose from a selection of predetermined loan repayment terms, such as five-, seven-, 10-, 12-, 15-, or 20-year periods. Some lenders may allow you to customize your repayment term with more specificity than this. Check to make sure that your lender allows penalty-free early repayment, so you have the option of paying off your loan sooner without facing fees.</p><h3>Can I refinance both federal and private student loans?</h3><p>Yes, you can, but it only works in one direction. Refinancing is only an option with private lenders; the federal government does not offer loan refinancing options (though it does offer <a rel=nofollow href=#>a variety of different repayment options</a>, including income-driven repayment plans that can help make it easier to pay back your loan over time). While you can refinance both federal and private student loans with a private lender, you can’t refinance private student loans with the government. Also, if you refinance your federal loans with a private lender, you may lose access to income-driven repayment plans, forbearance and deferral options, and other forms of debt forgiveness.</p><h3>Can I apply for student loan refinancing with a cosigner?</h3><p>Yes. Many student loan refinancing vendors offer borrowers the option to refinance with a cosigner, with <a rel=nofollow href=#>Laurel Road being but one example</a>. Keep in mind that your cosigner will be held legally responsible for your loan repayment to the same extent that you are as the original borrower, and their credit history can be affected by what happens with your loan. Be sure your cosigner understands their responsibilities—and pay your bills on time and in full.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmapnaKovK%2Bty2adoqaRo7Cme8Crq6KbnJp8o7HSrWSsrKWZsq%2FAjKWmmqZdp7Kntc2apZydXZi8rrzAp6Ceq18%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sting-joe-sumner-touir-father-son-interview-hollywood-bowl-1235743999.html>&#171;&nbsp;Endless Sumner: Sting and His Opening Act, Joe Sumner, on Their Father-Son Tour and Why the</a>

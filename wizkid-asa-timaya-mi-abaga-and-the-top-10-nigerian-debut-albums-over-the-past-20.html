Then, it got me thinking about how special debut albums are and how they could define a career for better or worse.</p><p>For artists like <strong>Kendrick Lamar, Jay Z, Wizkid, TuFace Idibia </strong>and more, they broke the mould and had amazing career runs after their groundbreaking debuts. But for others like <strong>Sean Tizzle </strong>and <strong>Wande Coal, </strong>their debut albums became the zenith of their careers. Even though some of these acts release other albums, they could never top their debuts.</p><p>Usually, a groundbreaking debut is material to a great career. Some people break the trend, but it's hard to build a career after a week debut. In Nigerian music, that is harder to achieve.

It was a 17-track album with no fillers - you couldn’t skip any song. By the time, Burna Boy was about to release his sophomore album, <strong>On A Spaceship </strong>- his hype had gone down.</p><p><strong>The Journey </strong>went on to be named <strong>Best Pop/R&B Album </strong>at the 2014 Headies.

That title might be true, but that pop sound was the refined version.

At helm of affairs was <strong>Major Banggz </strong>while Phyno was<strong> </strong>spat fire<strong>. </strong>If Nigeria will ever have its own brand of rap music, we have to go back to that sound or go a little forward to <strong>Young Jon</strong>’s serial madness on ‘Awon Goons Mi' and 'Cause Trouble.'</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Phyno was the producer-turned-swashbuckiling Igbo-speaking rapper with an avant-garde appearance. On ‘Obago’ he rapped, “East coast n**a banging in the west” and it was a fact. ‘Ghost Mode,’ ‘Obago,’ ‘Parcel’ and ‘Kush Music’ were mega-hits before his album dropped. When the album dropped, ‘Alobam’ became a cultural moment.</p><p><strong>Phyno </strong>was the cool kid with the cool fashion sense. ‘Alobam’ birthed merchandize and street culture. If MI Abaga visibly merged rap with pop music, Phyno blurred the lines.

He didn't just pull it off, he created a blueprint for Nigerian pop. Alongside <strong>Timaya</strong>'s <strong>True Story</strong> and <strong>Wande Coal</strong>'s debut, <strong>Mushin To Mo'Hits, </strong>it is the third progeny of contemporary Nigerian pop.</p><p>While the album was mostly based off Hip-Hop and R&B elements with slight cuts of alternative, the alum represented the Hip-Hop orient of its time while foreseeing a future. It didn't quite pull it off, but it did enough to get itself into the conversation. More importantly, it foreshadowed what is arguably the greatest career in contemporary Nigeria music.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>When it's all said and done, this album produced 'African Queen.'
